	<div>Chicken</div>
	<p>The chicken is a domestic bird used for meat and laying eggs, the meat that comes from such a bird, or is a slang term for someone who is fearful or cowardly. A bird that lives in a barn and lays eggs is an example of a chicken.
    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world.

	<div>Beef</div>
	<p>Beef is meat from a cow. It's also a word for a complaint. The word beef comes from the Old French word buef, which became the word for basically, cow meat. Beef is to cow as pork is to pig or mutton is to sheep.
	Beef cattle are cattle raised for meat production (as distinguished from dairy cattle, used for milk production). The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef.

	<div>Sushi</div>
	<p>Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish.
	The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori.
